## 🧠 My Mission in AI

My goal is to create AI-powered robots that go beyond conversation — robots that can **see**, **listen**, **understand**, and **respond** in meaningful ways. Inspired by technologies like **ChatGPT**, I'm working toward building systems that bridge the gap between software and real-world interaction.

To me, AI is not just about automation — it's about creating technology that improves how humans interact with machines in daily life.
